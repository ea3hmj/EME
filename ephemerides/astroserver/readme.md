# ASTROSERVER
Download install.bat and wget.exe to a directory on your PC and run install.bat.

It will run a program that will generate a kernel for our station-position.

The installer in the bin directory installs the AstroTracker.exe application that allows us to visualise the position of existing objects.

As a server user we must always use the callsign we have used in the makekernel program to generate our kernel.

Inside the kernels/scripts directory is the SondasUpdates.exe application that should be run periodically to update short-lived kernels.
